      <h3>#1.Listening to music</h3>
      <article class="listening music1">
        <p>Listening to music is my favorite hobby.</p>
        <p>I listen to music whenever I have time, but especially on my way to school. Because listening to music makes me feel less bored. </p>
        <p>I like various genres of music and listen to different genres of music depending on the situation I listen to.</p>
        <p>For example, I listen to exciting dance songs on my way to school and listen to ballad songs to concentrate when I study at school.</p>
        <p>In addition, when I take a break at home, I listen to exciting songs and sing along to relieve my stress.</p>
        <p>Like this, I enjoy listening to all genres of music. Below is the music playlist I've been listening to recently.</p>

      <article class="listening music2">
        <p>As I said earlier, there is a mix of different genres of music.</p>
        <p>I've been listening to a few songs over and over lately.</p>
        <p>I'm going to introduce a song that I like to listen to these days.</p>
      </article>
      <h4>Stars over me-BOL4</h4>
      <video width="400" controls>
          <source src="BOL4-stars over me.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
      </video>
      <p>It hasn't been long since I learned this song.</p>
      <p>But since I first heard it,It was good because the song and the atmosphere of the release date match well.</p>
      <h4>Four Seasons-TAEYEON</h4>
      <video width="400" controls>
          <source src="TAEYEON 태연 '사계 (Four Seasons)' MV.webm" type="video/mp4"/>
      </video>
      <p>This song seems calm, but the melody is addictive.</p>
      <p>So when I go to school, I listen to this song first.</p>
